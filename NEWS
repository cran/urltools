Version 0.6 (WIP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
*replace_parameter introduced, to augment extract_parameter (previously simply url_param). This
allows you to take the value a parameter has associated with it, and replace it with one of your choosing.
*extract_host allows you to grab the hostname of a site, ignoring other components.

BUG FIXES
*extract_parameter (now url_extract_param) previously failed with an obfuscated error if the requested
parameter terminated the URL. This has now been fixed.

DEVELOPMENT
*unit tests expanded
*Internal tweaks to improve the speed of url_decode and url_encode.
