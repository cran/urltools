//'@title Encode or decode a URI
//'@description encodes or decodes a URI/URL
//'
//'@param urls a vector of URLs to decode or encode.
//'
//'@details
//'URL encoding and decoding is an essential prerequisite to proper web interaction
//'and data analysis around things like server-side logs. The
//'\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{relevant IETF RfC} mandates the percentage-encoding
//'of non-Latin characters, including things like slashes, unless those are reserved.
//'
//'Base R provides \code{\link{URLdecode}} and \code{\link{URLencode}}, which handle
//'URL encoding - in theory. In practise, they have a set of substantial problems
//'that the urltools implementation solves::
//'
//'\itemize{
//' \item{No vectorisation: }{Both base R functions operate on single URLs, not vectors of URLs.
//'       This means that, when confronted with a vector of URLs that need encoding or
//'       decoding, your only option is to loop from within R. This can be incredibly
//'       computationally costly with large datasets. url_encode and url_decode are
//'       implemented in C++ and entirely vectorised, allowing for a substantial
//'       performance improvement.}
//' \item{No scheme recognition: }{encoding the slashes in, say, http://, is a good way
//'       of making sure your URL no longer works. Because of this, the only thing
//'       you can encode in URLencode (unless you refuse to encode reserved characters)
//'       is a partial URL, lacking the initial scheme, which requires additional operations
//'       to set up and increases the complexity of encoding or decoding. url_encode
//'       detects the protocol and silently splits it off, leaving it unencoded to ensure
//'       that the resulting URL is valid.}
//' \item{ASCII NULs: }{Server side data can get very messy and sometimes include out-of-range
//'       characters. Unfortunately, URLdecode's response to these characters is to convert
//'       them to NULs, which R can't handle, at which point your URLdecode call breaks.
//'       \code{url_decode} simply ignores them.}

//'@param urls a vector of URLs

//'@details It's useful to be able to take a URL and split it out into its component parts - 
//'for the purpose of hostname extraction, for example, or analysing API calls. This functionality
//'is not provided in base R, although it is provided in \code{\link[httr]{parse_url}}; that
//'implementation is entirely in R, uses regular expressions, and is not vectorised. It's
//'perfectly suitable for the intended purpose (decomposition in the context of automated
//'HTTP requests from R), but not for large-scale analysis.

//'@return a data.frame consisting of the columns scheme, domain, port, path, query
//'and fragment. See the '\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{relevant IETF RfC} for

//'
//'@examples
//'url_parse("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article")

//'@title Recompose Parsed URLs
//'
//'@description Sometimes you want to take a vector of URLs, parse them, perform
